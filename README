The nltk version is 3.0.0.

Hindi-Urdu Treebank (HUTB) Corpus is in CONLL format. The tree linearizer code (variant-generation-code.py) implements an algorithm that takes the dependency trees as input. The output that we get through this code is a set of counterfactual sentences with preverbal constituents re-ordered pre-verbally. The public version of the HUTB corpus is here: https://verbs.colorado.edu/hindiurdu/
